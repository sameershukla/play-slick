This project demo's RESTful service using Play and Slick FRM (ORM). It's 1-1 relationship between class Person and Address, Sample JSON required for input is 

{
    "personalInfo": {
        "name": "ABC",
        "email": "a@a.com",
        "age": 35,
        "sex": "Male"
    },
    "addressInfo": {
        "street": "A-1",
        "city": "ABC",
        "state": "ABC."
    }
}

- I tried to cover validation, proper error handling etc. Still few more enhancements pending
